# Example of how to access the weatherdata dictionary.
 
# Import requests

# key = 'api_key' - This key is different for everyone and so it depends on the website. 
# location = 'Any Location'
# url = "The base URL which should be given by the website but you have to add your key and location variables to the url."
# response = requests.get(url)
# data = response.json()

# print(data) - This prints the dictionary of that location, and we are easily able to access all data inside the dictionary.
# If the name of the location is an invalid location, it will print an 'error' dictionary.
